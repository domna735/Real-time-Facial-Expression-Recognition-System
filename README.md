# Real-time-Facial-Expression-Recognition-System
Development of a Real‐time 
Facial Expression Recognition System
 Description:
 Facial expression recognition has a wide range of 
applications, including human–computer interaction, 
advertising, and entertainment. This project focuses on 
detecting and analyzing human emotions through facial 
expressions. Various facial features and deep learning 
models will be studied to enhance recognition accuracy. To 
further improve performance, attention mechanisms will be 
applied to facial images and videos. Additionally, lightweight 
models will be developed to optimize efficiency while 
maintaining accuracy. By the end of the project, a system 
capable of real-time facial expression recognition will be 
implemented.
Development of a Real‐time 
Facial Expression Recognition System
 ❑Human beings express emotions through facial 
expressions in daily communications
 ❑Understanding these emotions
 and knowing how to react to 
people’s expressions greatly 
enrich human-computer 
interaction
 Ekman’s six basic expressions
 (the neutral expression not 
included)
Development of a Real‐time 
Facial Expression Recognition System
 ❑To perform facial expression recognition:
 1. Face detection
 2. Deep feature extraction (attention mechanisms, knowledge 
distillation to learn from a teacher network, advanced models)
 3. Classification
Development of a Real‐time 
Facial Expression Recognition System
 1. Study deep learning-based facial expression recognition
