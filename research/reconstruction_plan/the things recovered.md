## What has been recovered (details)


### 1) Reproducible manifests + data integrity gates (Recovered)

- Cleaned, standardized 7-emotion datasets under `Training_data_cleaned/`.
- Unified manifest `Training_data_cleaned/classification_manifest.csv` validated (path existence + decode sampling outputs under `outputs/manifest_validation*.json`).
- ExpW HQ / ExpW full manifests created and validated.
- Export tooling avoids silent “missing files = biased subset” by warning/dropping missing rows.

This is the v2-restart equivalent of the old report’s “path crisis + integrity recovery” principle.

### 2) Teacher training entrypoints + artifacts (Recovered for RN18 + B3 Stage A)

Implemented and validated:

- `scripts/train_teacher.py` supports ArcFace protocol, warmup/ramp, cosine+warmup scheduling, checkpointing (`checkpoint_last.pt`), and artifacts.
- RN18 Stage A & Stage B complete with artifacts (Stage B checkpoint currently stored under `outputs/teachers/test and other data/stage B/`):
  - `alignmentreport.json`, `calibration.json`, `reliabilitymetrics.json`, `history.json`
  - `best.pt`, `best.onnx`, `last.onnx`
- B3 Stage A completed with corrected setting parity (pretrained=true retrain).

### 3) Teacher ensemble exporter + aligned softlabels (Recovered)

- `scripts/export_ensemble_softlabels.py` exports:
  - `softlabels.npz`, `softlabels_index.jsonl`
  - `classorder.json`, `hash_manifest.json`, `alignmentreport.json`
  - `ensemble_metrics.json`
- Both prob-space and logit-space fusion supported; logit-space used as the default recommendation for KD “logits/T semantics”.

### 4) “Best overall” softlabels folder chosen (Recovered)

Decision is already made and documented in the ensemble report:

- Overall best for unified multi-source student training:
  - Dec-24 pack uses: `outputs/softlabels/_ens_hq_train_rn18_0p4_b3_0p4_cnxt_0p2_logit_clahe_20251223_152856/` (for student KD/DKD)
- RAF-DB-targeted best:
  - `outputs/softlabels/_ens_rn18_0p5_b3_0p5_rafdb_test_logit_clahe_20251220_154146`

Note: mixed-source benchmark selection evidence for RN18/B3/CNXT 0.4/0.4/0.2 is recorded in the report pack under `research/report 24-12-2025/report md file/02_teacher_model_ensemble_report.md`.

### 5) Real-time demo core loop + labeling artifacts (Recovered for teacher inference)

- Demo outputs are produced correctly (example folder):
  - `demo/outputs/test_RN18_stageA/` contains `per_frame.csv`, `events.csv`, `demoresultssummary.csv`, `thresholds.json`, `per_class_correctness.csv`.
- YuNet ONNX download issue (Git LFS pointer) fixed so demo can run reliably.

---

## What is NOT yet recovered (details)


### 1) Teachers not finished / not started

This is the biggest remaining gap vs the old interim report’s “teacher suite”.

- B3 Stage B: ❌ not done
- B3 Stage B: ❌ not recovered as a complete top-level run folder yet
  - Some Stage-B smoke artifacts exist under `outputs/teachers/test and other data/old data/` but are not the primary run folders referenced in the Dec-24 report pack.
- ConvNeXt-Tiny Stage A/B: ❌ not started
- ViT Stage A/B: ❌ not started
- RN50: ⚠ code supports training it, but no finished run exists.

**Note on ConvNeXt sensitivity (your reminder):**
ConvNeXt is the right backbone to “stress test” the pipeline settings because it is sensitive to augmentation/LR/warmup/margin schedule. But at this moment it is not trained yet, so the system is not fully recovered to the old report’s breadth.

### 2) Students (core deliverable) are still missing

This gap has been closed for a first seed (1337): CE/KD/DKD run folders exist with `best.pt` and `reliabilitymetrics.json`.

Remaining student gaps vs the old report:

- Multi-seed experiments (42, 2025) and a consolidated cross-seed summary
- Mixed-source evaluation of the student checkpoints on `Training_data_cleaned/test_all_sources.csv`

### 3) Four-way split KD + multi-teacher diversity (not recovered)

Old report emphasizes Four-Way Split KD and class-aware teacher assignments.

In v2-restart right now:

- Minimal RN18+B3 ensemble is recovered.
- Four-way split teacher set (RN18 + ConvNeXt + B3 + ViT) is **not possible yet** because ConvNeXt/ViT teachers are not trained.

### 4) NL / NegL are only scaffolds

- NL/NegL are implemented and wired into student training (see `scripts/train_student.py` NL/NegL flags).
- NL/NegL screening runs exist under `outputs/students/` (including KD/DKD variants with gating and saved `history.json` / `reliabilitymetrics.json`).
- Remaining gap: deployment-facing evaluation (real-time flip-rate/jitter metrics) is not yet integrated into the experiment loop.

### 5) Deployment engineering gaps (ONNX FP16 + latency benchmarks)

Old report includes ONNX FP16 export + latency goals.

Current:

- Teacher ONNX exists.
- Student ONNX + latency benchmark artifacts (e.g. `onnxexportreport.json`, `onnxparity.json`, `latencybenchmarks.csv`) are ❌ not done.

### 6) Domain adaptation & validation sets (hard/webcam)

Old report mentions webcam domain gap and a custom webcam dataset/validation.

Current:

- Demo can be labeled and logged.
- But we have not built:
  - a small hard-case validation set
  - a webcam validation subset
  - before/after “gap closure” logs

## Important differences vs the old interim report (why numbers won’t match)

If you try to directly compare old table metrics to new runs, note:

- Old report: canonical benchmark is **RAF-DB test** with calibrated temperature (T*≈1.2).
- Current v2-restart: many evaluations were run across different splits (fulltest multi-source, ExpW, AffectNet, uncleaned RAFDB, etc.). Those are harder and not apples-to-apples.
- Dataset index scale changed (old report states ~228k; current unified manifest is larger).

So “recovering the system” should focus on recovering the **pipeline + artifacts + reproducible gates**, then re-running the exact old benchmark configuration when needed.

---

## Next recovery steps (dependency-ordered)


### Step 1 — Finish the teacher set needed for four-way split

1) Complete B3 Stage B (or decide a smaller Stage B image size / fewer epochs if laptop power-capped).
2) Train ConvNeXt-Tiny Stage A/B using conservative settings first (because it’s sensitive).
3) Train ViT Stage A/B only if still needed for diversity; otherwise optional.

### Step 2 — Run student v0 (MobileNetV3-Large) minimal KD

- Train student with one teacher source first (use the recommended `fulltest` ensemble softlabels if the goal is generalization).
- Produce required artifacts:
  - `best.pt`, `history.json`, `metrics.json`, `calibration.json`, `reliabilitymetrics.json`
- Then run DKD baseline.

### Step 3 — Realtime demo with student

- Load student checkpoint in demo, run webcam smoke test, and record:
  - per-frame logs, events logs, per-class correctness
- Only then proceed to ONNX FP16 export + latency bench.

### Step 4 — NL/NegL integration (after KD/DKD stable)

- Add NL/NegL into training with an explicit smoke gate.
- Build small hard-case + webcam validation subsets for fair comparisons.
