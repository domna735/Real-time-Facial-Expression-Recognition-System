# Project Overview

## Real-time Facial Expression Recognition System

### Description
Facial expression recognition has a wide range of applications, including:
- Human–computer interaction
- Advertising
- Entertainment

This project focuses on detecting and analyzing human emotions through facial expressions. Various facial features and deep learning models will be studied to enhance recognition accuracy. To further improve performance:
- Attention mechanisms will be applied to facial images and videos.
- Lightweight models will be developed to optimize efficiency while maintaining accuracy.

By the end of the project, a system capable of real-time facial expression recognition will be implemented.
